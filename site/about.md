### Introduction

As with most Grasshopper plugins, Groundhog provides a number of new components that  offer users additional functionality or more convenient workflows. These new components are, for now, relatively simple methods for analysing or representing landscape features that are useful across a number of common scenarios.

Unlike most other plugins, Groundhog also attempts to provide comprehensive background information about how to use its own components and how to use computational design methods in landscape architecture more broadly. To serve this end it contains a range of documentation (by way of this website) as both written articles and reference models/ definitions.

Most of the functionality and documentation provided here is not at the bleeding-edge of computational design practice. But neither is landscape architecture. While there are plenty of researchers, practices, and schools that are pushing the limits of design technology in our discipline there are few open, detailed, and accessible guides for understanding *how* they are doing so. Moreover, almost all online resources for learning Grasshopper assume architectural intent and impart skills or techniques that are poorly suited to the design of landscapes. Groundhog aims to address this gap and provide capabilities and an understanding of what computation is, how it works, and where it can be useful in landscape architecture.

### Developer

Philip Belesky is an Associate Lecturer and PhD candidate in the Landscape Architecture program at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. He has previously worked as a programmer and computational designer. His current research explores the use of computational methods and tooling to design landscape systems â€” more information available at [philipbelesky.com](http://www.philipbelesky.com).
